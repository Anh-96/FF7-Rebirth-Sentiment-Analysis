       "8356   Would I recommend this game? Sure—if you can survive the Side Quest Vortex long enough to actually play it.\\r\\n\\r\\nListen, I came here to relive my childhood, to chase Sephiroth, to feel the epic weight of FF7’s legendary story. What I got instead was Mario Party: Midgar Edition, where my time was consumed by endless side quests that spawn more side quests like some kind of RPG matryoshka doll.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne minute, I'm hyped up for an intense battle—next thing I know, I'm three hours deep in a card tournament, desperately trying to win so I can unlock more actual storyline. And don’t even think about skipping these, or you’ll miss Cloud’s ultimate move because you forgot to rescue a squirrel stuck in a chimney or something.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let's talk about pacing. In the original, Aerith gets kidnapped by a mad scientist and the team is racing against time to save her. In this game? \"Wait, Cloud, before we go, let’s plant some flowers for the local orphanage!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople are dying, and Tifa’s having a moral crisis over delivering a sandwich.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s not all bad, though! The combat’s fun, the world is gorgeous, and the characters are still the ones we love—though they now feel contractually obligated to repeat their one defining trait during every side quest. Aerith is cryptic. Barret wants to shoot a Shinra guy. Tifa feels bad about it. Rinse and repeat.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinal verdict? It’s a fantastic game trapped inside a side quest simulator. I recommend it—if you have the patience to sift through 40 hours of busywork before you actually get to play Final Fantasy 7.  \n",

Sorry but you guys should have at least told us straight up that this is not really playable on handheld at all. Unless you start fixing it and adding the necessary upscalers such as AMD FSR3 and Intel XeSS then I will reconsider in the future. Got to refund for now.\\n\\nPS: This review is exclusively for Steam Deck's performance. The game is phenomenal finished it on PS5 deserved that GOTY 2024 nomination, can't wait for part 3 now that they confirmed story is complete and development is going smoothly. If you got at least an RTX or equivalent GPU, I highly recommend it 100% as this version is the definite way to play this game blowing the PISSER of PS5 PRO to Midgar Slums sewers. Seems like their optimization of the game is incomplete making the first section the ONLY optimized here and like a kid thinking it worked just call it a day and slap that \"Verified\" status. Hope the dev team keeps supporting this so we dont have to make our modders work their arses again fixing or improving your games.  \n",

Sure—if you can survive the Side Quest Vortex long enough to actually play it.\\r\\n\\r\\nListen, I came here to relive my childhood, to chase Sephiroth, to feel the epic weight of FF7’s legendary story. What I got instead was Mario Party: Midgar Edition, where my time was consumed by endless side quests that spawn more side quests like some kind of RPG matryoshka doll.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne minute, I'm hyped up for an intense battle—next thing I know, I'm three hours deep in a card tournament, desperately trying to win so I can unlock more actual storyline. And don’t even think about skipping these, or you’ll miss Cloud’s ultimate move because you forgot to rescue a squirrel stuck in a chimney or something.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let's talk about pacing. In the original, Aerith gets kidnapped by a mad scientist and the team is racing against time to save her. In this game? \"Wait, Cloud, before we go, let’s plant some flowers for the local orphanage!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople are dying, and Tifa’s having a moral crisis over delivering a sandwich.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s not all bad, though! The combat’s fun, the world is gorgeous, and the characters are still the ones we love—though they now feel contractually obligated to repeat their one defining trait during every side quest. Aerith is cryptic. Barret wants to shoot a Shinra guy. Tifa feels bad about it. Rinse and repeat.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinal verdict? It’s a fantastic game trapped inside a side quest simulator. I recommend it—if you have the patience to sift through 40 hours of busywork before you actually get to play Final Fantasy 7.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Square Enix developer team really thought they can get away with just slapping \"Verified\" for Steam Deck huh? Sorry but you guys should have at least told us straight up that this is not really playable on handheld at all. Unless you start fixing it and adding the necessary upscalers such as AMD FSR3 and Intel XeSS then I will reconsider in the future. Got to refund for now.\\n\\nPS: This review is exclusively for Steam Deck's performance. The game is phenomenal finished it on PS5 deserved that GOTY 2024 nomination, can't wait for part 3 now that they confirmed story is complete and development is going smoothly. If you got at least an RTX or equivalent GPU, I highly recommend it 100% as this version is the definite way to play this game blowing the PISSER of PS5 PRO to Midgar Slums sewers. Seems like their optimization of the game is incomplete making the first section the ONLY optimized here and like a kid thinking it worked just call it a day and slap that \"Verified\" status. Hope the dev team keeps supporting this so we dont have to make our modders work their arses again fixing or improving your games.</td>\n",
